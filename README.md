# JYP

This project displays 6 cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, New York, San Diego, & San Francisco) 
and retrieves 10 businesses from a selected city via the Yelp API

# Configuration
After cloning the repo and launching the app either on an IOS device or on an XCode simulator,
you must access the app settings on your device located in the Settings App under the JYP app section in order to populate the API Key.

Fill in the authorized Yelp API key under the "Yelp Key" setting then return to the app.

# Current Location
The app also allows the user to use their current location if they choose. However, if the App is run from an XCode simulator then the location of the user is assumed to be in San Francisco. The actual current location of the user will be used if the App is run from their device, not a simulator.
